# Shopping Cart API using Microservices

This project implements a shopping cart API using Spring Cloud and Docker. It follows a microservices architecture where different services communicate with each other to provide a seamless and scalable shopping experience. The services are containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and management in various environments.

## Features:
- **Microservices-based**: Each component (e.g., cart service, product service, user service) runs as an independent microservice.
- **Spring Cloud**: Leverages Spring Cloud for service discovery, configuration management, and fault tolerance.
- **Dockerized**: All services are packaged in Docker containers, enabling smooth deployment across different platforms.
- **Scalable**: Designed for scalability, allowing easy scaling of individual services based on demand.
